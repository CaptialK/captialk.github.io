          <h2> A lot to say  </h2>
          <p class='ab'> I'm a recent graduate from the UCSC Film & Digital Media Department. <br>
             I've worked for two years as a visual freelancer working independently and with teams. <br>
            My focus is in 3D animations, but I also have a background in editing and directing videos. </p>

          <h2> Early Life </h2>
          <p class='ab'> In high school, I was that kid who had a hard time paying attention in class. <br>
            Except for my first photography class where I got access to a camera.<br>
            This is where my passion for photography and storytelling began.<br>
            Things haven't changed much .... though I did start paying attention in class.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <h2> College </h2>
          <p class='ab'> In college at first, I planned my career out as a photography.<br>
             After creating a video essay for an assignment.<br>
             I was hooked by the video aspect of storying telling, also the praises were nice too. <br>
             A collection of consecutive images moving at 24fps became my medium. <br>
             In this time, I freelanced and became enamored in 3D animations. <br>
             I ended college with a BA in Film & Digital Media at UCSC. </p>

          <h2> Nowadays </h2>

            Hopefully we meet in the real world someday and will be able to collaborate on a project together. </p>
